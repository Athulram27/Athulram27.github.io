My career has been shaped by curiosity and growth, transitioning from manufacturing to data analytics. Beginning as a Quality Assurance Lead, I discovered a passion for using data to drive improvements, ultimately leading me to pursue a Master’s in Business Analytics from the University of Maryland. Over five years, this journey has sharpened my ability to turn complex data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making.
