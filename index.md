##ABOUT

I am Athul Ramachandran, a Master’s candidate in Business Analytics at the Robert H. Smith School of Business (University of Maryland), focusing on advanced data analytics, predictive modeling, and strategic optimization. My journey began in the manufacturing industry, where I worked as a Quality Assurance Lead. There, my passion for statistics and data analytics took root, leading me to transition into the field of data analytics and business intelligence. Over the past five years, I have built a strong foundation in both the manufacturing and IT sectors, particularly in strategy formulation, decision-making, and optimization projects.

With a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, I am driven by a deep enthusiasm for mechanics and automotive engineering. This blend of technical expertise and strategic insight equips me to contribute effectively to data-driven decision-making and optimization projects.


##INTEREST AND INSPIRATIONS
I’m motivated by several passions that enrich my day-to-day life. Hiking and long drives top the list, offering a refreshing sense of adventure and tranquility. Music is another big part of my world—especially indie and experimental genres. I love discovering niche sounds that reveal unique creative expressions.

Cooking is also a favorite pastime. Experimenting in the kitchen with recipes from around the globe allows me to explore new flavors and techniques, bringing a piece of the world to my table.
